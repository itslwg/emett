# Ensemble Model for Emergency department Trauma Triage (EMETT)

This is the code repository of the "Ensemble Model for Emergency
department Trauma Triage (EMETT)" study. The bulk of the code is in
[./R](./R), but testing can and perhaps should, be performed from
[./playground.R](playground.R), located here in the top directory. The main function
is [./R/make.study.r](make.study.r), which calls, either directly or
indirectly, the functions in remaining .R files.

#### To run the code
Two options:
1. Run the study analysis by running `RunStudy.R` in the [./R](./R) folder.
2. Run the study analysis by running from `playground.R`.
